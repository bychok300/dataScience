THis survey is pretty clunky, I guess you're trying to collect raw user data, but i felt like it lacked focus in regards to actual effects of nofap and your feelings towards it instead of shit like ""how many kids do you have"" and badly scaled questions like "" do you think porn/masturbation is wrong""   and unscaled questions like ""do you excercise alot? only yes or no please"" .can anyone say whether porn is ""wrong""? especially with the options you give? how can something be ""wrong for some people""? there's no magical group that's immune to bullshit, it's a stage in life development. It sounds like you're giving people the option to say ""I'M one of those people for whom porn is bad. Some lucky OTHER people wouldn't have this problem but I do."" no you're just at a stage in your life where these things can grab hold of you easily and you need to grow. this isn't demographics.

other clunkiness: trying to be inclusive ends up drawing lines between people. gay and lesbian can just be ""homosexual"" imo, you've already asked for gender (which is also lacking in options, the focus on transexuals is odd leaving out those who would just identify as genderqueer or genderless etc. if you're going to give people options do some research. i know it's mostly wannabe alphas here but all the more reason to work on your approach, so they don't get all scared and skew your data with compensated manliness lol.

pm ghoststory if you wanna talk about anything. i know it's tons of work to put this shit together but

The longest I had ever gone before now was two months, I think having a community to hold me accountable and having a counter/badge to be proud of really helped.  

I noticed the classic increase in motivation and energy since I began, but now that I am nearing the 90 day mark all that motivational energy is gone. I have had my ups and downs, but now that I have conquered masturbation it almost seems like I have nothing to focus on or go after.

It seems to be we may have some big problems in the future. We could have an entire generation of young men with either sexual issues or no sexual interest, thanks to being sated by HD mass internet porn. We could have an entire generation unable to realise their potential because their drive and energy is all exhausted by porn. Or we may have no problems at all.

However, after my first sexual encounter, my partner commented that it ""took me a long time"" and I began to consider that a combination of physical desensitization and weird sexual head-space from pornography may have contributed to making it difficult for me to orgasm. With this in mind, I gave r/nofap a second look, read some of the literature, and ultimately decided to give ""fapstinence"" a try to see if it addressed the problem. It made a noticeable difference within a week and overall led to a more comfortable and intense sexual experience. I remarked earlier that ""man on top vaginal penetration"" was both the most common sex act and the one most likely to make me orgasm, but for about the past month I have been fully capable of reaching orgasm in a ""woman on top"" position as well, and both positions are generally represented in sexual encounters. I have had no ""lapses"" since I decided to start, though this could be because, when tempted, I have been able to look forward to sexual encounters in the future and could feel an improvement in them which I associated with my ""fapstinence.""  At one point during our relationship a combination of school workload and spring break meant that my partner and I went without sexual contact for 3 weeks, but I felt that my temptation ""levelled off"" after roughly two weeks and did not get significantly more intense after that. My partner and I will be separating at the end of the school year, as she is graduating and subsequently leaving the country while I am not; I plan to continue my fapstinence until the end of a nominal 90-day ""reset"" period as a personal challenge, at which point I will consider whether I wish to resume masturbation and possibly viewing pornography.

I soon ended my 8-year streak by masturbating for the first time to a more instructional porn — I didn't know the motion or effort for masturbation with orgasm.  I didn't understand masturbation before that time, so I had never masturbated during my previous pornography viewing.  At that point I subscribed to r/NoFap because it seemed like a good way to investigate an unknown territory for myself.  After about a week of masturbating 2-3 times/week without porn (after the first time), I found my physical limits.  The next week, I masturbated to porn with the intent of arousal, despite what I had read on r/NoFap because I wanted to push beyond my limits.  It worked, but not the next day or the day after that.  It was at that time that I decided to take r/NoFap seriously and get a badge/day counter.  My goals are to limit myself to one fap a week without any porn.",,Large Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Large Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Large Increase,Modest Decrease,Modest Increase,Modest Decrease,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Large Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Modest Decrease,Stay the Same / N.A.,Large Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Decrease,Modest Decrease,Modest Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Large Decrease,Large Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Large Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Large Increase,Large Decrease,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Decrease,Modest Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Entirely fapstinence,Unsure,N/A,N/A,Unsure,N/A,N/A,No,N/A,N/A,Caucasian,Less than once a month,Student,Some college,United States - West,"$50,000 to $74,999",3,Libertarian (progressive-leaning),Don't know / not sure,Strongly disagree,Don't know / not sure,I would have neutral feelings about it,0.2627114075

It wasn't until I was 12 that I understood what it was and began doing it willfully. I started watching internet/cable  porn at around 14 years of age. Over many years I have experienced countless cycles of extreme sexual desire followed by guilt and depressed mood post-act. I have tried to stop myself from the habits countless times, for various reasons. I used to experience some pain and discomfort back when the pleasure was most intense, which caused some of my depressed mood. I have had low self esteem and pursued only relationships only a few times in the last 10 years, with unhappiness. I was able to stop myself from watching porn (not including some wikipedia images) for a few years until the end of my last period of fapping abstinence. I can recall only 3 or 4 times that I was able to quit fapping for extended periods of times (weeks or months). The last time was for about 130 days, the first semester of college. I was able to keep abstinent since I was in a new environment which was not conducive to the habits and had experienced a traumatic loss of a pet, which was a large emotional weight to bear. Around that time I also became very religious, thinking that I needed saving and that was the only route by which it could be done. The period of abstinence like all others came to an end with the need to satiate my sexual desire. I haven't tried to stop for 3 years now and pleasure and satiation are diminishing and elusive. In my failure and unhappiness I slowly lost my religiousness, as the associated commands of scriptures brought too much pressure and I found them to be unreasonable and without any authority. I came across the TED video which led me to here. I have once again become aware of my issues, discovering the scientific explanation of my experience with arousal and the problems associated with it. I am going to try to make changes in my habits, and this time my abstinence will not be done by guilt and shame, but by my new understanding.",Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Decrease,Modest Increase,Modest Decrease,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Don't know / don't care,N/A: I'm not a NoFapper.,N/A,N/A,N/A: I'm not a NoFapper,N/A,N/A,N/A: I'm not a NoFapper.,N/A,N/A,Caucasian,Never,Student,Bachelors degree,United States - Midwest,"$100,000 to $124,999",4,Libertarian (progressive-leaning),Don't know / not sure,Don't know / not sure,Don't know / not sure,I would be somewhat bothered,0.04707927603

- Feel better about not having to 'hide my habit'/ worry about getting caught
- Easier to make eye contact with random people (mostly girls) in the eye when passing by
- No 'fapper's regret' feeling

I am more a collector type of person. I have a huge amount of pornographic material + it is very organized.

I knew that i am spending more and more time looking for new stuff. I knew i had to stop. So i erased 2 times all my stuff. I was 16 years old and 18 years old at that time. In both scenarious i felt ashamed and escaped into rational behaviour.

As the time passed by, i kind of accepted my addiction to pornography. It was like it was a part of my ""dark passenger"" (aka dexter).

What really got me was that TED-talk about internet-pornography. The presentator had reffered to /r/NoFap. It got me thinking wtf i am doing all day long.

In the last few weeks i felt really no interest in real women. I even couldnt pretend to be interested. I felt a little bit numb. I now think that this was/is connected to the high increase of pornography in the last few weeks of my life.

I am willing to try it out NoFap. I hope to recreate my interest in real women. I hope to live a better life than before. To use my youth.

I'd just like to say thanks for taking the time to do this guys, you've made a big change in my life, and it'd be nice to see how other people feel about it, as well as having some hard data! Not fapping in itself doesn't change your life. It's what you do afterwards, and I am using this as a springboard to do things that I should have done a long time ago.

As I continued to be a virgin, the stress built.

As a comment, it's great to see the subreddit has been upgraded with this survey and more information in the sidebar, but I take issue with the Jargon section.  In my two months here, I have never seen anyone use the following words or abbreviations:

Schlicking: Female equivalent of fapping
PIV: Penis in Vagina
YMMV: Your Mileage May Vary
Blue Petal: Female equivalent of blue balls

The female equivalents contribute to a more friendly atmosphere for everyone, so I don't have a problem with them, but I see no reason for the PIV and YMMV abbreviations.  I don't know if these actually are used obscurely, were actually used at one point or if a mod has invented them.

I noticed a distinct change in my behavior and mental state. I was no longer depressed, I was motivated to get things done, and I was never bored. I enjoyed talking to people(which is very unusual for me) and I felt like I could say anything, my inhibition was drastically lowered.

Then I relapsed and looked at porn and masturbated again regularly. My problems, my depression, apathy and laziness came back. I saw Gary Wilson's video and realized I have a problem.
Now looking at porn makes my head hurt because I know I'm hurting myself. I avoid it whenever possible. It's been 6 days and I'm trying to keep my head on straight but it's difficult. I've edged a couple times, but now I know I need to stop that too.
Whenever I'm not actively trying to distract myself I cannot stop thinking about sex and I have to force myself to think about something else. It's a little maddening.

The only time I do not experience this is when I'm too exhausted to think(so I stay up all night often) and when I'm out taking a walk, which puts me at a state of serenity and peace.

Things I've been doing to occupy myself is getting deeper into some recreational interests, such as RPGs, and I've been studying japanese. It feels like progress, some headway in bettering myself. When the weather clears up I'll start running too.

Masturbating to me was something I just ""did"".  I'd get home from work and it helped me de-stress, or I'd be at home alone and bored.  At one point in time I would masturbate before I'd go on dates so that if I did end up having sex that night, I knew I'd last longer.  I have always been able to take vacations for a week+ and never worry about masturbating, or feel a strong urge to run off and have a quick wank, so like I said before - I never gave much thought to masturbating and it's affects.  I think porn really is more of the issue for me.  I am a fun, outgoing male who has no problem talking to people, yet I would find myself nervous talking around a girl I was interested in or found attractive because I would instantly start thinking ""this girl has tits, I like tits, tits remind me of porn, porn reminds me of sex, what if this girl and I have sex, oh now I'm nervous because all I'm thinking about is having sex with this girl"".  That quickly escalating train of thought would occur and then I'd sieze up in conversation.  Now, while in conversation with an attractive woman or one that I'm really digging I still have the same initial thought process of ""oh tits!  This woman has them!""  But then I've noticed that I switch from normally becoming nervous at my spiraling train of thought and instead think ""Well I do like tits, and I haven't had sex/masturbated/orgasmed in a while - I wonder what I have to do to see these tits...How can I fuck this girl?"".  And honestly, that's a really good feeling.  It's the most alpha train-of-thought I've had in years and it gives me confidence in other aspects of my life.  While I'm not like some that all of a sudden start going out and learning to play new instruments, or pick up 30 new hobbies - This is a big hurdle for me, one I owe to NoFap and for that I am happy that I took on this challenge.  It's like when I used to smoke pot all the time and then stopped.  It was tough at first to stop, not because I was addicted to Marijuana but because it had become a habit - Something I did after/during certain situations.  But eventually I built new habits and the want to smoke diminshed.  Sure I think about it from time to time, but I never act and then the feeling subsides.  This I can see, is currently happening with masturbating - And I'm comforted to know that these feelings will pass and new opportunities in life will arise I never thought of before.",Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Large Increase,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Large Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Large Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Large Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Large Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Large Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Large Increase,Large Increase,Large Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Large Increase,Large Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Large Increase,Stay the Same / N.A.,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Large Increase,Modest Increase,Modest Increase,Mostly fapstinence,Yes,8 - 14,8 - 14,Yes: once,1 - 29,1 - 29,Unsure,N/A,N/A,Caucasian,Never,Employed for wages,Bachelors degree,United States - West,"$25,000 to $49,999",21,Libertarian (conservative-leaning),Strongly disagree,Strongly agree,Agree,I would be greatly bothered,0.4450764991

As a Christian, it has been encouraging to me that people of other faiths have also recognized PMO as a problem, and that the things I've been told my whole life have been affirmed for me, in a positive way.

Since doing NoFap, I've noticed a lot of other issues and problems that need work in my life. Once my fapping problem was ""out of the way"" I could see and deal with them a lot more clearly. I've taken up exercise and goal setting and proper nutrition.

I think the biggest thing I've learned while doing NoFap is how damaging porn is. I used to believe that masturbation was the problem and that porn was just the means of doing it, but I've realized that porn is the problem and masturbation just amplified it.

I feel like I have a more relaxed tone when talking to people.  Partially I feel like this is caused by a heightened and more constant awareness.  However, I believe the differences are more subtle than one would expect given the testimonies I've read on r/NoFap.  

Additionally, I have noticed a significant resurgence in sexual appetite for what I would call ""normal"" girls.  Pornography really does raise one's expectations to a ridiculous level.  This is probably even more true for those who have little sexual experience.  Almost paradoxically though, I feel as if ""normal"" girls are more attainable than what I previously believed under heavy masturbation cycles.  I attribute this to rising confidence.   

On the whole, I'm incredibly glad that I found NoFap.  I had tried several times to quit masturbating only to fail quite pathetically.  NoFap introduced me to the YourBrainOnPorn website which allowed me get a better grasp on what truly causes this addiction and how it is physically working in my brain.  This information removed a lot of the mysterious struggle I had with porn.  The problem now seems more down to earth.  Previously I felt like my problem was solely because of something intrinsically wrong with me and nothing I could do would ever reduce cravings.  Although I have slipped up on occasion, my overall masturbation habits have significantly decreased since arming myself with this knowledge.

NoFap itself is a nonjudgmental community that provides a lot of good tips on how to remove pornography from your life and focus more on actual fulfilling sexual activity.  It's definitely one of the better subreddits because it's focused on actual self improvement not just wasting time.

Not the least of which is the appalling lack of experimental based evidence, which I believe this survey will do nothing to fix. 

The most glaring problem is, what is the physiological difference in the human brain and/or body between masturbating to porn and having sex with some one?  Seriously, I want some one to show me a qualitative difference in human physiology between these two scenarios: Scenario 1: Everyday for a week my wife dresses up in a different sexy/slutty outfit and gives me a strip-tease then bringing me to orgasm and Scenario 2: me then watching strangers do that very same thing on a computer screen while masturbating to orgasm.

I fail to see how we can possibly call one good and one bad. 

The second thing that bugs be about r/nofap is the smug, but subtle, sense of superiority that people seem to carry, that everyone should just stop fapping already and destroy all the porn.

I'm a firm believer in ""No pain, no gain."" And NoFap is definitely one way to make a lot of gains in your life.

I couldn't possibly recommend NoFap any more than I would eating healthy, breathing, and exercising.

Cognitive:
Increased confidence
Increased attention and focus
Increased motivation to learn and succeed
Increased cognitive performance, problem solving (e.g. programming stuff) has improved
Greater short and long term memory
Better mood and outlook
More outgoing
Reduced insomnia, more refreshing sleep
More emotional energy
Vivid dreams and dream recall
Better social interaction with people
More interested and attracted to women
More patient - I may be sitting in class for two hours, but time flies by and I'm paying attention to the work. Before I would have groaned at the clock every two minutes just so I could get home and waste time.
Able to run further, more motivated and energetic. Feels good man.


Physical:
Senses have become more acute, that or heightened perception
More energy
Sense of touch becomes more… sensitive. Less of that numb feeling.
Better complexion. No pimples.
Darker, thicker facial arm and leg hair
Faster facial hair growth
Better complexion, skin seems more lively and better colour. Not sickly and dull.
Minor sores and cuts healing faster
Somewhat better metabolism 
Natural fat loss - I used to be a skinny kid, did no exercise for the past 3 years and got a little bit more chubby, now at 30 days my frame is going back to normal. Haven't done any exercise yet. I built up a lot of muscle in the past 3 weeks as well, now it seems to have gone away a bit. Going to get that muscle back and get rid of that little bit of extra fat. 
Back problems are gone, probably to do with nofap zinc and the spine. 
Wet dreams without repercussions
Higher libido
Better muscle gain

I am now flirting with further cutting down the chronic stimulation of my reward circuit by tackling my overreliance on technology and the Internet.  I find myself considerably more relaxed when I trade computer time for socializing -- no surprise there -- or reading, even if the content is similar to what I might read on a monitor, so this seems promising.

My answers to the questions of social outlook on the final page do not reflect some judgment on my part of the individuals who engage in such behaviors, but rather what I think is optimal for lasting social health and stability across all spectra wherewith one might attempt to classify the general population.
